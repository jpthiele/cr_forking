# German tacos

This recipe is taken completely out of mind.

As german culture tends to welcome other cultures, I have come up with the German taco, that combines the swifty tacos from Mexico with the best cuisine in Germany

- Sauerkraut
- 2 Bratwurst [Preferrably mixed meat from pig and cow]
- Tomato sauce
- Tortilla of choice, warmed in a dry pan
